# Leo-III Lambdapi Examples


This repository contains examples demonstrating the ongoing work on the integration of the higher‑order logic automated theorem prover [Leo‑III](https://github.com/leoprover/Leo-III) with the Dedukti framework through output proofs that are verifiable using the interactive proof assistant [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi). The encodings and examples presented here are part of ongoing research described in the unpublished paper *Formal Verification of Proofs from Automated Theorem Provers for Higher-Order Logic*.

This repository provides an overview and example applications of all of the encodings derived in the project so far. Some of the rules listed here have since been integrated into the Lambdapi standard library (for instance, the rules shown here in `simpRules.lp` are now included in `propExt.lp`, and the rules in `Disj.lp` and `Conj.lp` make up the standard library files with the corresponding names `Disj.lp` and `Conj.lp`). Rules that are not part of the standard library but are used in our encodings live in the companion library [Leo-III-lambdapi-lib](https://github.com/Deducteam/Leo-III-lambdapi-lib). This repository complements them with theoretical encodings of rules for which the automated encoding is not yet implemented in Leo‑III’s Lambdapi output. All encodings of the *full* EP calculus are collected in `epCalculus.lp`.


## Repository Structure

- **`lambdapi-examples`**
  A Lambdapi package containing encodings and some examples:
  
  - **`examples.lp`**  
    Provides various examples extracted from the paper. These examples illustrate:
    - Techniques for the application of encoded inference rules.
    - Handling implicit transformations such as permutation.

  - **`epCalculus.lp`**  
    Contains the encodings of the full EP calculus—both for rules whose verifiable Lambdapi output is already generated by Leo‑III and for those that are not—together with examples demonstrating each encoded rule’s application.

  - **`clausificationRules.lp`**  
    Encodes the Boolean identities used in Leo‑III’s clausification procedure.

  - **`implicitTransformations.lp`**  
    Encodes the implicit transformations encodable as equalities invoked in the examples.

  - **`simpRules.lp`**  
    Encodes the Boolean simplification identities used in Leo‑III’s term‑simplification, along with a user‑defined Lambdapi tactic that applies them exhaustively.

  - **`Disj.lp`** and **`Conj.lp`**
    Encodes the implicit clause‑ and literal‑level transformations `transform`, `permute`, `delete` and `select`. 
  
  - **`Makefile` and `lambdapi.pkg`**  
    Package files required by Lambdapi.

- **`README.md`**  
  This file.

## Prerequisites

Some of the encodings rely on features added after the latest stable releases of Lambdapi and the Lambdapi standard library. You must install the latest development versions of both. Please follow the instructions in the respective repositories for:
- [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi)
- [Lambdapi Standard Library](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi-stdlib)


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Verify the Proofs:**
   The proofs in the repository can be checked by running:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   or interactively using one of the user interfaces (e.g. VS Code) provided by Lambdapi.
