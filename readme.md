# Leo-III Lambdapi Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the ongoing work on the integration of the higher-order logic automated theorem prover [Leo-III](https://github.com/leoprover/Leo-III) with the Dedukti framework through output proofs that are verifiable using the interactive proof assistant [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi). The encodings and examples presented here are part of ongoing research described in the unpublished paper *Towards the Verification of Higher-Order Logic Automated Reasoning* by Taprogge, Blanqui, and Steen.

> **Note:** The files `extt.lp` and `rules.lp` in this repository are extracts from a larger repository, [Leo-III-lambdapi-lib](https://github.com/melanie-taprogge/Leo-III-lambdapi-lib), which contains all of the encoded rules and implicit transformations of Leo-III to date. In this repository, only the encodings necessary for the verification of Cantor’s theorem and for the examples have been included.

## Repository Structure

- **`cantorsTheorem.lp`**  
  Contains a proof of Cantor’s Theorem in the Lambdapi format automatically generated by Leo-III.

- **`examples.lp`**  
  Provides various examples extracted from the paper. These examples illustrate:
  - Techniques for the application of encoded inference rules.
  - Handling implicit transformations such as permutation.

- **`rules.lp`**  
  Contains extracts of the inference rule encodings, simplifications, and implicit transformations necessary for verifying the examples and Cantor’s theorem. For the full set of rules and transformations used in Leo-III, please refer to [Leo-III-lambdapi-lib](https://github.com/melanie-taprogge/Leo-III-lambdapi-lib).

- **`extt.lp`**  
  Provides definitions and encodings related to extensional type theory (ExTT). This file is also an extract from [Leo-III-lambdapi-lib](https://github.com/melanie-taprogge/Leo-III-lambdapi-lib).

- **`Makefile` and `lambdapi.pkg`**  
  Package files required by Lambdapi.

- **`README.md`**  
  This file.
